We investigated the video game data that we found on Kaggle. It includes the Game, Platform, Publisher, Sales and other information about video games published in the past. We made a total of 3 interactive plots (country sales by genre, global sales by genre, and platforms by genre) in which users can navigate and explore. Have fun exploring.
